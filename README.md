Attention Please - (Not just a side project â€” a daily-use product with purpose)


Attention Please is a cross-platform desktop productivity and digital wellness application built using Electron, React, and TypeScript. Designed to support deep focus and healthier screen habits, it integrates seamlessly into your system tray to gently guide users toward balanced and distraction-free computing.

A desktop companion that promotes mindfulness without getting in your way.

Architecture & Design

* Modular Architecture: Clean separation of UI, services, and logic
* Event-Driven Background Tasks: Timers, reminders, and focus checks run silently
* Design Patterns:

  * Singleton for tray services and background tasks
  * Observer for real-time state updates and user alerts
* Modern UI/UX: Responsive, dark/light mode, accessible and intuitive

Why It Stands Out

* Full-stack desktop application
* Real use-case: wellness and productivity
* Background services and system-level integration
* Elegant UI with meaningful utility
* Recruiters appreciate real-world, user-focused tools
